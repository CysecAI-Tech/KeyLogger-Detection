🛡️ Advanced Keylogger Detection and Prevention System
📋 Project Overview
A comprehensive cybersecurity tool designed to detect, analyze, and prevent keylogger threats on Windows systems. This system employs multiple detection techniques to identify suspicious activities that could indicate the presence of malicious keylogging software.
🎯 Problem Statement
Keyloggers pose a significant threat to personal and organizational security by:

Stealing sensitive information (passwords, credit card numbers, personal data)
Operating stealthily without user knowledge
Transmitting captured data to remote attackers
Bypassing traditional antivirus solutions
Causing financial and privacy losses
